# This Repository was for my successful attempt to learn React.js
I wanted to create a frontend for the flask API that I had to built to get my Udacity Nanodegree, and this was the result of my testing!
## Running Locally
To run this frontend, stand up the backend, and then run the following commands in the root folder. (Assuming you already have Node Package Manager installed)
```
npm install
npm start
```
## Permissions
As pretty much all of the API Interactions require permissions, if you want to test out the interactions, you can simply remove the permission declaration in the requires_auth decorator in the backend, and this will allow you to use the endpoints as long as you have created an account by using the login button on the account page
